# STAMP-benchmark
Benchmarking tensor operations across frameworks with precision profiling, and deployment readiness
# 🧪 STAMP: System for Tensor Analysis, Memory, and Precision

**STAMP** is a modular benchmarking toolkit that profiles tensor operations across modern ML frameworks—**PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, and **JAX**—with support for **mixed precision**, **GPU memory tracking**, and optional **Streamlit-based visualization**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🔄 Matrix multiplication + gradient benchmarking
- ⚡ AMP, FP32, BF16 precision modes
- 📊 GPU memory profiling per run
- 🐍 CLI-driven benchmarking interface
- 🐳 Docker + Docker Compose support
- 📈 Streamlit dashboard (WIP) for visual analysis
