Expanded Future Enhancements (Now Part of Workflow)
| Category | Feature | 
| 📊 Visualization | Live plotting with matplotlib or seaborn | 
| 🎛️ Interactive UI | Streamlit dashboard for benchmark exploration | 
| 🧪 Regression Testing | Store results as JSON + benchmark history to spot performance drifts | 
| 🌐 Deployment | Docker-based containerization for reproducibility & scalability | 
| 📦 Package It | setup.py and CLI entry point for tensor-benchmark command | 
| 🧠 Model Support | Extend beyond matmul to include Conv2D, RNN, and transformer blocks | 
| 🧮 Model Zoo Bridge | Benchmark real-world models (ResNet, BERT) via TorchHub or TF Hub |

[]: # ## 🛠️ Development Workflow
[]: # 
[]: # 1. **Add New Benchmark**: Implement in `benchmarks/` with framework-specific logic.
[]: # 2. **Update CLI**: Extend `main.py` to support new benchmarks.
[]: # 3. **Run Tests**: Ensure all benchmarks pass with `pytest`.
[]: # 4. **Visualize**: Use `scripts/benchmark_dashboard.py` to explore results.
[]: # 5. **Document**: Update README and add usage examples.
[]: # 6. **Commit & Push**: Follow Git best practices, open a PR for review.
